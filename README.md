--- Background Story for Hail to the King --

The land of Aarondel was once a peaceful land centered on commerce, trading with the forest elves to the west and the Heftypants dwarves and Wankendriver Gnomes in the northern mountains. Exiled from the Underdark, a mind-flayer took refuge within the city. As it grew in strength through harvesting humans, king Ethric's wife, Elthamira, disappeared. Ethric employed all of the kingdom's resources in the search. Upon discovering the beast, he sent in his royal gaurd and, after a desperate battle, the blight was killed. Before any form of joy or triumph in conquering this evil, Ethric discovered his wife's corpse within the beast's lair. In his despair, he resolved to bring her back and reverse the tragedy by any means necessary. Ethric began researching the forbidden art of necromancy alone in his throne room. For months he read and re-read every tome and scroll in the kingdom pertaining to this dark magic. Finally, he began the ritual to bring back the dead. King Ethric succeeded in returning Elthamira to the land of the living, however, he paid a grave price. Ethric forever lost his sanity along with Elthamira. Together they scourged the land they once loved, bringing everything they had built to ruin. Refugees from Aarondel called upon the bravest and strongest heroes to save them. This is where the story of Hail to the King begins...
